## Explorers

Explorers are so called “creatures” whose only aim in life is to reach the target (red square on top). You will observe that initially the mutation rate is 3% which gives use the result around 20-22 generation and if mutation rate is increased to 10%, result is obtained around 18-20th generation.

But if mutation rate is increased to 50%, the result is obtained around 50-55th generation!

I have started with initial population of 250.

Here the fitness function is the reciprocal of distance of the species from the target. The closer it is to the target, the more “fit” it is.
